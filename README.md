# Full-stack-app
A simple full stack app I saw off of YouTube to learn.
I found this video from "Tech with tim" and I wanted to learn the process of combining react with flask and using a database. so i learned things like lambda functions, SQLAlchemy(i personally found interesting) and using CORS. i learned the best way to use jsonify the purpose of using models and even made an API.
